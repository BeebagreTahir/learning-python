# Character   Meaning
# 'r'         open for reading (default)
# 'w'         open for writing, truncating the file first
# 'x'         create a new file and open it for writing
# 'a'         open for writing, appending to the end of the file if it exists
# 'b'         binary mode
# 't'         text mode (default)
# '+'         open a disk file for updating (reading and writing)
# 'r+'        Will over write the sstart of data (no trucket)

#---------For opening and reading a file-----------

# f = open("text.txt","r")
# data = f.read()
# print(data)
# f.close


#------------For reading just one line---------

# f = open("text.txt","r")

# line1 = f.readline()
# print(line1)

# line2 = f.readline()
# print(line2)

# f.close


# ----------------------> Writing to a file<--------------

#to change all text of file or overwrite it
# f = open("text.txt","w")

# f.write("I want to quit the job")

#To add text to the end of file or append text
#--->if there is no file exist and run the code python will create a file with that name
# f = open("text.txt","a")
# f.write("\n I am really good at programming")




# -----------------------------> With Syntax "clean way "<------------------ by using with file will automaticly be closed


# with open("text.txt", "r") as f:
